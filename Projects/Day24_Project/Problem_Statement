For this project we're going to be creating a dice roller for n-sided dice.

The user is going to be able to specify a selection of dice using the following syntax, where the number before the d
represents the number of dice, and the number after the d represents how many sides those dice have.

=> python main.py 3 -d 6

In addition to printing this result to the console, we're also going to keep a permanent log of the rolls in a file
called roll_log.txt. The user can specify a different log file if they wish with an option argument called --log.

=> python main.py 2 -d 10 --log rolls.txt

In addition to specifying a custom log file, the user can specify a number of times to roll the dice set using a
--repeat flag.

=> python main.py 6d4 --repeat 2

Both --repeat and --log should have appropriate documentation, and the user should be able to use -r and -l as short
versions of the flags. The user can also use both the --repeat and --log flags if they want to.
