Using the dataset present in iris.csv:

1. Create a scatter plot where the x axis is the species and the y axis is one of the other columns.

2. Via a user menu, tell us the column they would like to plot in the y axis.

3. Also via the menu, tell us the name of the file they would like to create to contain the final plot image.
