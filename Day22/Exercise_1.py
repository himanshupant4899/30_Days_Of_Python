# Below you'll find a list containing several tuples full of numbers:
numbers = [(23, 3, 56), (98, 1034, 54), (254, 344, 5), (45, 2), (122, 63, 74)]

# Use the map function to find the sum of the numbers in each tuple. Use manual iteration to print the first two results
# provided by the resulting map object.
answer = map(sum, numbers)
